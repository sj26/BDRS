To re-generate the bindings:

xjc.bat ogckml22_modified.xsd -b bindings.xjb

The bindings file puts everything in the correct package, (au.org.earthwatch.kml...). 
The modified xsd has the deprecated Snippet removed from AbstractObjectType as JAXB cannot 
deal with the case insensitive snippet and Snippet.
